A technical term for "mindset shift", and a fundamental to overcome plateaus in growth.

Breaking out of maladaptive patterning into cognitive restructuring allows your brain to take a different stance, one that mitigates the pitfalls of showing up for yourself online. Replace the doom mindset with a growth mindset, and you'll see less of the bad stuff, like decision fatigue, analysis paralysis, and procrastination.
