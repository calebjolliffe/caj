In today's working world, profits come before everything. It's our job as employees to ensure we're sufficient at our job. This is why I've taken a page out of Elon's book and adopted a sufficiency-first approach to my work. 

We are not often ruthless enough with our simplification efforts, and it's common for software to become bloated and redundant. In short, it's full of excessive junk. I don't know about you, but I don't enjoy building something I know is excessive junk.

The big question I ask myself constantly sounds something like this: "Why add 6 if I only need 2?". Obviously this question can be reconfigured to your specific use, but the underlying message remains the same. Why continue adding what isn't needed?

The main benefits of adopting a sufficiency-first approach are found in the offcuts. When you simplify and eliminate ruthlessly to focus on crafting sufficiently, a few things happen.

- You reduce overhead costs; less resources, less labour
- You get faster; your time value increases
- You gain clarity; you pinpoint your product/service's essentials

This is just what happens internally. To your customer or client, they're on the receiving end of a better product or service.

Sufficiency-first building is a win-win for everybody.
