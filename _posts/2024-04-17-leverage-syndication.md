A key principle of the IndieWeb is POSSE: [Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere](https://indieweb.org/POSSE).

Implementing POSSE in your workflows allows for increased ownership and control. You own and control your canonical URLs, you're less dependent on silos (and less affected by their failures), and search becomes much more effective.

Wherever possible, start on your site, then branch out. Leverage the compounding effects of writing once, posting twice.
