I'm a huge fan of giving more than you take. If you document your process while working, you set yourself up to share your wealth of experience and knowledge with those that want to be where you're at. They're here to learn from you, to do the work that you do, and that's a prime opportunity.

Giving more than you take builds a loyal group of people that provide you with the opportunities meant for taking. This ensures two things:

1. Your loyal group is genuine
2. What you take is also genuine

By showing up consistently and cohesively, you not only embody your values and principles (exactly what we're aiming for), but you build a reputation with others that guarantees that when the time comes to take instead of give, your gains are automatically in alignment with your values.
