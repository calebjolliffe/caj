As GDPR compliance ramps up, I can't help but feel frustrated at how many more popups I notice. It seems like every website and their mother is screaming "Hey, we're tracking your every move! Take it and like it!" from the rooftops with every cookie notification, no matter how many toggle switches they provide.

It's more than possible I was just a naive kid like so many others, but I miss the days of analytics being a source of wonder and inspiration rather than manipulation and selling. My Tumblr blogs and early websites all made use of visitor counters and little code snippets for weary Web travellers to proclaim their "I was here"s as a sort of nod of acknowledgement, an "I see what you're doing and I appreciate you" as much as planting a flag on the Moon or at a mountain's summit. Something that said "You're doing this thing, and I got to be here to witness it".

I remember a time when getting a Gumroad sale notification meant racing to my Gumroad dashboard to see if a new country was lit up on the map. To my knowledge, that feature is long gone, and I think with it went my sense of wonder at mapping out my little corner of the Internet. It's certainly made my corner feel much smaller.

Building in public has always been screaming into the Internet's void and crossing your fingers in hopes that you're heard, but the shift in recent years makes the echoes feel few and far between, no matter the outcome of whatever's being built.

I hope I'm not the only that feels this way.

If I've landed on your radar, shoot me an email at calebjolliffe@proton.me and let me know where you're reading from. I don't have anything to sell you, and I definitely won't add you to my Manipulation Database. I just think it'd be neat to see my map light up again.

As for what's next, I'm considering two things:
1. Adding a guestbook for a new generation of Web traveller proclamations
2. Trying out [Fathom](https://usefathom.com) or [Plausible](https://plausible.io) for GDPR-compliant analytics

If you've got first-hand experience with any of the above, I'd love to hear your opinions. 

Until then, happy Internet travels. I'll catch you next week.
