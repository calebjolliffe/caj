*Do the research, take the action.* Two simple steps that the majority of people don't follow. I myself am guilty of it at times.

When I think of "sources of truth", I don't use the prophetic sense. I don't subscribe to ideas of "one singular truth" for everyone or everything, and sources of truth are no exception. Instead, I view sources of truth as people who take those steps to be the living embodiment of their values:

1. Do the research
2. Take the action

That's it. A simple, distilled process to live your values.
