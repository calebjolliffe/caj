I was terrible at sports growing up. I'm not exaggerating. I was so bad that coaches would routinely pull my parents aside to voice their concerns that it just "wasn't the right sport for me". This happened in every sport I tried.

In my mid-twenties, I can look back and see what happened:
- I didn't suck at swimming, I just have a late birthday. I struggled to keep up with the other kids because I was often almost a year younger and several inches shorter than everyone there. That's a massive disadvantage for a kid learning to swim.
- I didn't suck at baseball, I just didn't know I was left-handed. I was the worst pitcher for most of the season because I was throwing with the wrong hand.
- I didn't suck at soccer, I just genuinely don't like it. Sorry soccer fans, the mud puddles, worms, and cloud shapes were just far more interesting. Also the late birthday thing was definitely a disadvantage here too, it's terrifying to have kids 6 inches taller sprinting at you.
- I didn't suck at gymnastics, I just thought it was more fun than serious. I probably dodged a bullet on this one.
- I didn't suck at basketball, I was actually pretty decent at it. I realized pickup games with my Dad were way more fun than playing competitively, so I stopped pursuing it after failing at school tryouts a handful of times.
- I didn't suck at karate, I was just four. I'm all for discipline-building, but sometimes kids just need to be kids.

Eventually, I tried bowling as a last-ditch attempt on my Mom's part. Lucky for her, I loved it. It's a mental endurance game more than a physical one, and I loved eventually learning about the physics behind it (it's pretty cool). It's even fun enough for young kids that I ended up sticking with it for a little over a decade. It was nice to have that consistency in my life, and as a sweet bonus, I ended up being good enough at it that it paid for the two college programs I dropped out of.

All that's to say, if you're not seeing the results you want, maybe you're looking in the wrong place. You're not actually bad at what you're doing, you just need to find the tweaks that give you an advantage.

When you find your advantage, you're golden. Double down on it and enjoy the growth.
