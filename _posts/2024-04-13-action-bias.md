Favour action over inaction.

When building in public, action leads to results. Inaction leads to stagnation, procrastination, and self-imposed failure.

That's why the [No Days Off philosophy](https://calebjolliffe.co/no-days-off) works: you're not leaving space for the hesitation that leads to inaction and its consequences.

By choosing to build with a bias for action, you choose to begin a *cycle of doing* rather than perpetuating the cycle of *thinking*. You do the research, then take the necessary action.

Put your thoughts into action. You know what you need to do, so get to work.
