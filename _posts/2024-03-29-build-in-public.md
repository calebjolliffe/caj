I struggled with impostor syndrome this week and feelings of "being behind". I wrote and abandoned five posts. It didn't feel right to post any of them. Instead of continuing to ruminate on my "failed" posts, let's talk about building in public.

This week, two close friends started building in public.

[Jira](https://janjira.work) launched a new iteration of her website and began documenting in her "journal" section as well as on [X](https://x.com/janjirasun/status/1772404525371994251?s=20).

[Joe](https://joeczepil.com) also launched a new iteration of his website, and with it, a log of what he's been up to.

I've been referring to this shift in personal site content as "slow sharing". I've been finding websites becoming more personal again and depending less on scripts and bulky libraries. Instead, they rely on simple HTML and the creator's love for learning and sharing. 

The burnout hasn't simply vanished along with the deleted scripts and CSS rules, but it has been nice to feel a sense of the early web again.

In the spirit of building in public, and "more sharing, less JS", here's what I got up to this week:

- With the help of [Teach Yourself C in 21 Days](https://nibmehub.com/opac-service/pdf/read/Sams%20Teach%20Yourself%20C%20in%2021%20Days.pdf) and the quintessential [K&R](https://a.co/d/50GXwLo), I started learning C.
- Inspired by [Jason McCarthy's video for Huckberry Homes](https://youtu.be/oHn6iLT0M0A?si=aSVzqHpUlOFuv5Ve), I started [rucking](https://www.goruck.com/pages/what-is-rucking#:~:text=it's%20a%20fitness%20thing.,hiking%20is%20simply%20called%20rucking.).
- I reread Cal Newport's [Slow Productivity](https://calnewport.com/slow/).
- I minified my website's code. It didn't do much to lower my carbon usage, as my site's built with Jeykll and I haven't found a viable way to minify YAML or Markdown without using JS. [Let me know](mailto:calebjolliffe@proton.me) if you have a method.
- I created the first iteration of a new project's website. (Details soon)
- I cleaned nearly 100gb of files from my various hard drives. It's made my almost 6 year old MacBook Pro feel brand new.

Those things aside, the bulk of my week was spent getting back to basics. Once we're past Easter, I'll be putting my head down and putting my updated systems to the test. Ideally, I'll have the MVP for my new project ready within 6 weeks- hold me to it.

I'll be building much more frequently in public, and I'm excited to share it all with you.

Catch ya next week,

Cal

PS: Joining the [One a Month Club]() is the easiest way to support my work, keep the lights on, and hold me accountable to finish this MVP. It's by no means necessary, but immensely appreciated. Also, be sure to show [Jira](https://janjira.work) and [Joe](https://joeczepil.com) some love.
